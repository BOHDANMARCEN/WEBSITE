# Bohdan Martseniuk — Security-First AI Systems Engineer

**Version: v1.0 · Security-first personal site**

**Founder & Lead Developer · Security-First AI Systems Engineer**

I design and build **controlled, local-first AI platforms** and **infrastructure-level tools** — focused on security, predictability, and long-term operational control, not black-box automation.

My work spans the **entire engineering stack**: from autonomous AI agents and custom-trained generative models to real hardware and private infrastructure — where reliability, auditability, and ownership matter.

## 🧩 Philosophy

I believe AI systems must be:
- **bounded**
- **auditable**
- **predictable**
- **human-controlled**

AI should **extend human capability**, not replace responsibility.
